cretae docker image(folder :-> /c/Program Files/Docker Toolbox)
1. docker file/image create

#This is sample docker image cretaed by rashmi, its mysql images
FROM mysql

ENV MYSQL_USER=testuser \
    MYSQL_PASSWORD=test \
    MYSQL_DATABASE=dev \
    MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=letmein \
    MYSQL_LOG_DIR=/var/log/mysql


 EXPOSE 3306/tcp


2, built docker image
$docker build -t dockerfile .            (dokerfile -is docker file name)

3. to check this image docker container running or not
docker images  (see ur image in all running docker images)

4. now we have succefully created one docker images , and we can create instance/container of this image by ruuning iamge
$ docker run -d dockerfile   (it will create a long id  and will start process in background -d)

5.below big no , which come from above script
$ docker exec -it f88ee151559a4e29cea3bd05fffc907cd858fbdfd02d8f51f7a1b4bd7ccccda0 /bin/bash

6# mysql -u root -p
pass: <provide root user password>
mysql>

$docker rmi (to remove docker image and docker container)
There is a difference between docker images and docker containers. Check this SO Question.

In short, a container is a running instance of an image. which is why you cannot delete an image if there is a running container from that image. You just need to delete the container first.

Docker ps -a               # Lists containers (and tells you which images they are spun from)
Docker images              # Lists images  
Docker rm <container_id>   # Removes a container

Docker rmi <image_id>      # Removes an image 
                           # Will fail if there is a running instance of that image i.e. container

Docker rmi -f <image_id>   # Forces removal of image even if it is referenced in multiple repositories, 
                           # i.e. same image id given multiple names/tags 
                           # Will still fail if there is a docker container referencing i
